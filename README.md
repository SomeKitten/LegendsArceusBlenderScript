# Pokémon Switch V2 Blender Addon 3.3.x and WIP 4.0.0
A Python script for Blender to import models from Pokémon Games in Nintendo Switch (VERY WIP)

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this
https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html

The formatting of this script is a bit wonky, but that's because I wanted to make it
look as close to the original maxscript as possible.
That way, it's easier to compare the two and see what's different.
